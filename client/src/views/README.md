# 'src/views' (templates)

> Templates don't have any Data

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.
Template displays all the necessary page components functioning together, which provides context for these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.
Important characteristic of templates is that they focus on the page’s underlying content structure rather than the page’s final content
