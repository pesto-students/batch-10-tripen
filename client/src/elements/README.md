# 'src/elements' (atoms)

> Should Contain Basic Presentational/Logical Components.
> Helps in easy switching of Libraries

These atoms include [basic HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.
Ideally this folder should contain nothing, as HTML elements are **the** unbreakable building blocks upon which all Higher order components are built upon.
In fact there is a [Periodic table mentioning basic HTML elements](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/images/content/html-periodic-table.png).
