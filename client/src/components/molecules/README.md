The molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a [search form molecule](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/images/content/molecule-search-form.png).

Creating molecules helps UI designers and developers to adhere to _Single responsibility Principle_.

**The result is a simple, portable, reusable component that can be dropped in anywhere**
