# 'src/components'

This folder will contain all components that would be used in our application.
Its majorly divided into 5 parts:-

- atoms (HTML elements)
- molecules (Group of HTML elements)
- organisms (Group of molecules and/or HTML elements)
- templates (Group of organisms and Molecules without any props or Data)
- pages (Templates with Data)

- Atoms are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.
- Molecules are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components.
- Organisms are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.
- Templates place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.
- Pages apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.
